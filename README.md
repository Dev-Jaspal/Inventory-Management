# Clothing Stock Management System

Our system will be designed to manage stock in a warehouse, focus on clothing storage. The system will be used by store managers and employees to record each new item in and out of the storage. Managers and employees will be differentiated by the employee ID and they will have different responsibilities. Users can update the quantity of an item and add new category. 

Technologies we have decided to develop our system are MS SQL server to save detail of products and employee information, for structure of the system we are using HTML and Bootstrap framework. For frontend development we are using ReactJS and for backend we are using Dot Net to generate APIs.  

## User Interface Design
